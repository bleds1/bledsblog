Those graphics, loading screens, the box art and the music was an incredible multimedia experience at the time. Cartoons and comics had a similar role in firing me up but I will always have a soft spot for the charms of the Amiga and the late 80&amp;rsquo;s and early 90&amp;rsquo;s. I spent a lot of time thumbing through those plastic cases of copied Floppy disks with mysterious names scrawled on their labels. Each felt like a journey into a little world of imagination. The Amiga graphics might seem primitive now but the amount of creativity loaded into these little disks was insane to me. I still emulate the Amiga today and probably get more of a dopamine boost from the nostalgia than I do more modern day games. I even setup my modern desktop environment to have a retro feel of those simpler times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because we had an Amiga growing up I&amp;rsquo;ve always been quite handy with computer stuff and pick up digital tools pretty quickly. I&amp;rsquo;m learning pixel art as almost a side project. I enjoy learning and experimenting with new ways of working. It&amp;rsquo;s nice to have that beginner&amp;rsquo;s mind with something again. I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with more recent pixel art programs like &lt;a href=&#34;https://aseprite.org/&#34;&gt;Aseprite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://grafx2.chez.com/&#34;&gt;Grafx2&lt;/a&gt;. Even trying to use the old stuff like &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deluxe_Paint&#34;&gt;Deluxe Paint&lt;/a&gt; with a mouse through emulation. It almost feels like revisiting my childhood and remembering what made me want to do art in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:bledley@posteo.com&#34;&gt;‚úâÔ∏èReply by Email&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bledley.xyz/index.xml&#34;&gt;üì∞  Subscribe with RSS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
