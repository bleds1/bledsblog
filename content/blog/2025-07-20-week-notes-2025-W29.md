## Wins ⭐
 
 - Put on an event on Friday night. We hardly sold any tickets in advance and 2 acts pulled out on the day. It was looking a bit bleak initially. When it came down to it, the turn out was alright, the room was full enough and the vibes were good. I was particularly impressed with Liverpool band [Ancient Hostility](https://ancienthostilityfolk.bandcamp.com/album/sing-as-loud-as-you-can) and the experimental films of [Things Found and Made](https://www.instagram.com/thingsfoundandmade).
 
## Art 🎨

- Made a little progress on some studies in Krita. Working on the habit of getting started with something early before the day gets in the way.
 
## Reading 📚
 
 - Just been reading the internet mostly this week.. yeah.. I know.. but like.. peoples small blogs and stuff with RSS - not trash.
 
## Writing ✍🏻
 
- Had to rebuild my Hugo site on Monday - deleted all the old posts (still have the markdown files locally). I would have had to go through all the old posts and adjust the formatting of the internal links. A lot were just event promotion or art dumping with little accompanying wordage anyway. I'd prefer an almost clean state with just a few recent posts and build from that. That took more time out of my week than it should but I think I understand this theme better now. 

- Published recently on the blog:
    - [I'm ditching Letterboxd](/im-ditching-letterboxd) 
    - [A new theme, a new hope](/a-new-theme-a-new-hope)
 
## Health 💪🏻

- Upped my average daily steps but not as many runs as I'd like - I could blame the weather..

## Watched 📽

- The Ugly Stepsister (2025)
    - A Norwegian 'The Substance'. Similar themes of unattainable beauty standards with some gruesome body horror. It's a dark fairy tale/horror take on the Cinderella story. It's good, not for the squeamish. One you may need to recover from.
- The Flash (2023)
  - Mostly annoying multiverse stuff but was surprised to hear Michael Keaton's Batman is in it, so I had to check out those bits.
- Dexter Resurrection 
    - I'm liking the female detective who "sees things others don't". No idea what's going on with Uma Thurman's character yet? - some kind of secret society for serial killers?
- Narcos
  - I don't know why it took me so long to get around to watching this. Already feeling very absorbed after the first few episodes.
 
## Interesting 🤔

- Trying out [olauncher](https://github.com/tanujnotes/Olauncher) on my phone. It's a really simple, minimal Android launcher without any icons and just text.
