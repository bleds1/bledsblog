## Wins ⭐

 - Created a series of promotional posts, bio's and images for performers at a [gig](https://www.ticketsource.co.uk/navigators-art-performance/yo-underground-4/e-ajgyzm) next week
 
 - Implemented an invisible [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) module that calls my email syncing script. It calls [mbsync](https://isync.sourceforge.io/mbsync.html) and does some initial [notmuch](https://notmuchmail.org/) tagging. Another custom module shows a simple indicator for new and unread mail.
 
- Adding many blogs, socials accounts and YouTube channels to my [RSS reader](https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed) to seriously reduce use of distracting, bloated websites.
 
## Reading 📚

 - Finished reading [Mastering Emacs by Mickey Peterson](https://www.masteringemacs.org/). I did skim over some parts as this is more of a reference book.
 
## Writing ✍🏻

 - Posted to the blog ['Being Less Evil'](https://bledley.xyz/posts/2025-07-08-being-less-evil/) about disabling evil-mode in [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs).
 
## Health 💪🏻

 - I got a couple of short but fairly lame runs in. The heat has been pretty wild this week. If I don't get out early I'll likely not go at all.
 
## Watching 📽

 - Watched PSG v Real Madrid but tuned in late and missed all the goals.
 
 - Some old episodes of DS9. I'm looking for some funky aliens to draw.
 
 - First two episodes of Dexter Resurrection. Dexter makes me feel nostalgic about the early 2000's.. glad it's back.
 
## Play 🎮

 - When I get a minute I've been playing [Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Clancy%27s_Splinter_Cell:_Chaos_Theory) on Xbox.
 
## Listening 🎵

 - Had a bit of a wine and music night Saturday, posted some ska tunes to [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@bledley).
 
## Improvements ⬆

 - Not making enough time for artwork. I have a couple of monochrome studies on the go in [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) but I don't feel they are worth rendering out to completion. I need to start something new, fresh and more exciting.
 
 - Really need to increase my exercise. Just going for some good long walks will likely improve my running performance.
 
 - I want to get out more with my camera so I've got some material to post to [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.social/bledley).
 
 
## Interesting 🤔

- [powRSS](https://powrss.com/index.html) is a nice way to discover lots of small web blogs.

- [Nerd Fonts Cheat Sheet](https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet) I get so much use out of this in my configs.
